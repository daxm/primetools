llloop.py
---------

Automatic work assignment and submission script for clLucas (and
possibly CUDALucas).

Similarly to mfloop.py, this script aims to submit completed work,
found in result.txt, to Primenet, and fetch new work into
worktodo.txt. One essential difference, though, is that clLucas takes
the work as a command line parameter, rather than reading the file. So
this script also parses the assignment and runs clLucas with the
necessary parameters.

While clLucas only takes one exponent at a time, this script allows
you to cache more assignments in worktodo.txt, using the -n
option, so it can provide more work even during network outages.

The network/file operations and clLucas are done in a sequential loop
ad infinitum. You can finish current work by setting -n 0.

Naturally, since clLucas does not touch worktodo.txt, this script
clears assignments from the file, once completed.

By default, llloop.py fetches double-checking work, but you can also
select first-time LL work with -T 100 or 102. The reason for the
default choice is mainly because clLucas and this script are rather
experimental, compared to the mainstream GIMPS software.

GPU72.com is currently not supported, as LL work is not available
there. Should the situation change, it would be trivial to add here,
as the functionality already exists in mfloop.py.
